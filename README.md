Getting Started
---------------
Set up your project in your code directory
```
git clone https://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus-gulp.git your-project-folder
cd your-project-folder
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin your-repo-url
```

Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run the server
```
gulp
```

Deploy to Github Pages
```
gulp deploy
```

Or install the [Proteus gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus) and enjoy some shortcuts.

Stylesheets, images, fonts, and javascript files go in the `/source/assets/` directory.
Vendor stylesheets and javascripts should go in each of their `/vendor/` directories.
The source folders for images and fonts have a `.keep` file in them so they can be in the repo, but you can remove those files.
