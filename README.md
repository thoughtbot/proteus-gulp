Getting Started
---------------
Set up your project in your code directory
```
git clone --bare git@github.com:thoughtbot/proteus-gulp.git your-project-folder
cd your-project-folder
git init
npm install
```

Run the server
```
gulp
```

Deploy to Github Pages
```
gulp deploy
```

Or clone the repo and use these handy shortcuts: `. bin/setup`, `. bin/server` and `. bin/deploy`

Stylesheets, images, fonts, and javascript files go in the `/source/assets/` directory.
Vendor stylesheets and javascripts should go in each of their `/vendor/` directories.
The source folders for images and fonts have a `.keep` file in them so they can be in the repo, but you can remove those files.
